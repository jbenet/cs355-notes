# cs355-notes

Notes for Dan Boneh's cs355 (stanford/cs355/2014-spring). This is an [CC0 open archive](#License) for educational purposes.


Obvious, Obligatory Warning: do not post any answer to any homework content, etc. If you do, that's an honor code violation. Don't do that.

## Contribute

Please contribute! Post on [this issue](https://github.com/jbenet/cs355-notes/issues/1) to get commit access.

## Formats

The source documents will be in AFM (athena flavored markdown). This means markdown + latex + tikz are allowed. And it has concept-graph linking built in! If you're curious about how/why all this, ask about it.

## Process

This _collaborative_ archive requires a great deal of work (and need your contribution):

- take down notes @ lecture.
- add them here.
- formatting/cleaning notes.
- making diagrams (use tikz! tikz will be [compiled to svg](http://juan.benet.ai/note/2014-03-09/tikz2svg/)).
- presentation tooling (compiling notes, website, etc).

Note: I'll mostly be guiding this and handling cleaning/diagrams/tooling. _I will not be taking down notes_. I am absolutely terrible at it, and in most cases typing seriously distracts me from understanding concepts. Others are already taking down notes, so please contribute them! Also, it is best that as many people as possible take down notes, to make sure we capture it all.
